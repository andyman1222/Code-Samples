# Code-Samples
Repository for showcasing code samples to demonstrate ability in software practice in jobs. This repository does not contain full projects, rather public snippets of full projects which may be public or private.

This repository is intended as a prime example of software development on my own demonstrative end. In addition to showcasing good practices, I hope the code presented also showcases more complex and advanced functionality in a manner which can be understood. Furthermore, samples such as commit history and readme files can be further examined for software practices.
